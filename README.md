#Design Principles
    - Modern C99 syntax
    - Compiler friendliness at cost of verbosity and duplication
    - Minimum usage of pointers to avoid obfuscation
    - Strong typing through single parameter structs 
    - Enforce compile time verification whenever possible, but not at cost of performance
